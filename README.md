# xarray-contrib

xarray-contrib is a GitHub organization for gathering high-quality open source projects that build on [Xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/).

## Vision

As more and more projects build on Xarray, we wanted to provide a central place to collect community projects. We hope that including projects under the xarray-contrib organization improves project visibility and increases the likelihood of sustainable open source maintenance and development.

## Requirements

- Supports a recent version of Xarray
- Available on GitHub
- Open-source license
- Documentation (i.e. user guide, API reference, usage examples)
- Unit tests + continuous integration
- PEP8 compliant

If you have a project that meets these requirements, open a [new issue](https://github.com/xarray-contrib/xarray-contrib/issues/new/choose) in this repository to discuss transfering it to the xarray-contrib organization.

## Disclaimer

This organization is merely a container for projects that use Xarray. Projects included in xarray-contrib organization are not supported by the Xarray Core Developer Team.
