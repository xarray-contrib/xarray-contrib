# xarray-contrib

xarray-contrib is a GitHub organization for gathering high-quality open source projects that build on [Xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/).

## Vision

As more and more projects build on Xarray, we wanted to provide a central place to collect community projects. We hope that including projects under the xarray-contrib organization improves project visibility and increases the likelihood of sustainable open source maintenance and development.

## Guidelines

Projects in xarray-contrib should contain sufficient functionality and documentation to be useful and welcoming to new users. They should also follow software development best practices:

- Open-source license
- Supports a recent version of Xarray
- Available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) and/or [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/)
- Documentation sufficient for new users to get started, which typically includes:
    - A user guide or tutorial
    - Usage examples
    - API reference
- Unit tests + continuous integration
- [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) compliant code style

If you have a project that meets these requirements, open a [new issue](https://github.com/xarray-contrib/xarray-contrib/issues/new/choose) in this repository to discuss transfering it to the xarray-contrib organization.

## Disclaimer

This organization is merely a container for projects that use Xarray. Projects included in xarray-contrib organization are not supported by the Xarray Core Developer Team.
